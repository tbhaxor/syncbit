# syncbit

Syncbit is an incredible website transfer toolkit written in golang which means there is no doubt it will be resource efficient, threaded and fast. This project was creation when I 
became frustrated with migration ~30 websites from one server to different servers. Doing the repeated task again and again was too overwhelming. So I decided to automate this with
simple and human-readable config file.

+ zip and unzip command on the remote server
